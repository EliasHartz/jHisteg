- one could give a warning when versions are not subsequent the order is reversed. Tool will compute stuff but one could at least inform the user...
- expand syntax changes to include line number (may-have to make code moves human-readable, the necessary information is the method only anyway)
- one could make the metric scales values configurable via Command Line...
- how about a separate scaler for additional method calls THAT COULD NOT BE MATCHED? To emphasize newly added method functionality more...
- use context information from the exported source code ONCE the syntax changes have a line number
